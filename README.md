# Black-Friday-Sale-Analytics

🛍️ Black Friday Sale Analytics 📊

📌 Overview

This project dives deep into Black Friday sales data to uncover customer purchasing patterns, demographic influences, and product category trends. Using Python's data science stack, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insight generation to better understand consumer behavior during big sale events.

The dataset contains information about customers (age, gender, occupation, city), their purchases, and product categories.
The goal is to:

🔍 Explore sales trends

👥 Understand customer demographics

📈 Identify high-value product categories

🛠 Prepare data for possible predictive modeling

🛠 Technologies Used
Technology Purpose

🎨 Seaborn	Advanced and attractive statistical plots

📓 Jupyter Notebook	Interactive data analysis


📂 Project Workflow


📥 Data Loading

Read dataset (black_friday_dataset.csv) into Pandas DataFrame.


🧹 Data Cleaning

Removed unnecessary columns (User_ID, Product_ID) to focus on analytics.

Checked and handled missing values for product category columns.


🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of purchase amounts.

Purchase patterns by Gender, Age, Occupation, City Category, and Marital Status.

Heatmaps and bar charts to visualize correlations.


📊 Insights Generation

Found top spending age groups.

Gender-based average purchase comparisons.

Popular product categories.


🎯 Business Value

Insights can help retailers optimize product placement, target marketing campaigns, and plan inventory during big sales.
